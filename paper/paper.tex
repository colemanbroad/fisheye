  It is difficult to accuratley segment densely packed nuclei in 3D fluorescence images, especially in living samples where image quality varies significantly with space and time. In images with anisotropic resolution, segmentation quality is limited predominantly by the resolution of the undersampled axis. Here we extend a recently introduced technique for anisotropic image restoration based on convolutional neural networks to the context of 3D segmentation and demonstrate its effectiveness by segmenting densely packed nuclei in anisotropic 3D images of the zebrafish retina.
